Coded the game of BlackJack using Java in my junior year of high school.

The main objective of Single Deck Blackjack is to get a hand value of 21 or as close as possible to 21 before the dealer without busting (going over 21). An alternative is 
to stand and have the dealer bust. Before the game starts, you place a bet. Then you and the dealer are dealt cards. The dealer is dealt one face up card and one face
down. You are dealt two face up cards. Based on the cards in front of you and the face up card of the dealer you decide whether to stand(stop drawing cards), hit (draw more 
cards), double down (not in this code) or split cards (not in this code). Once the player is done, then the dealer will draw cards until they reach a number greater or equal 
to 17. If they draw anything 22 or above, they bust.
